### We tried to keep the game board simple and intuitive. Simply drag the pieces on the left to one of the 4 containers.

* The first category is the left side of the Venn Diagram. Category 2 is the right, and the third category is the overlapping section.

* The black hole acts as a discard pile for items that don't match any of the current categories.

# Scoreboard

### At any time after logging in players can click the star in the top right of the window to see their history of scores (the lower the better).

# Rules

### The rules are kept in an easily accessible modal that can be brought up at any time during the game for player convenience.

### As an additional tool, we've provided an optional checklist that slides in from the right for the player to keep track of which pieces they've already tried.
